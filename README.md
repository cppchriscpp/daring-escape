# Closing In: Barney's Daring Escape

Coded in 48 hours for [Ludum Dare 42](https://ldjam.com)

Theme: Running out of nes-starter-kit. 

This is heavily based off of **nes-starter-kit**. I did a lot of hacky things here; if you want a good starting place definitely check that out.

## Why isn't there much here?

I was tired after the Ludum Dare compo ended, and didn't really write much. There's plenty of information about the game itself on
the Ludum Dare website, and my personal site. NES Starter Kit has plenty of information about how to make a game, and is extremely
well documented as well, so I have a hard time seeing a reason to really write much here.

If this really takes off or something I'll certainly clean this up a bit. 

Feel free to contact me over email (see my Github user profile) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cppchriscpp) with any questions 
about this game.
